I'm assuming that a lot of people come to the StatLab with experience in R or SPSS, but might be new or a novice to Python. I just wanted to say that you shouldn't be scared of learning Python â€” as knowledge in R or SASS sets you up with a lot of the basic intutition for coding in Python, and you're already ahead of the curve! \n",
